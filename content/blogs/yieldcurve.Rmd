Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. There's further information from an article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). 

First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01
```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}
yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))
glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!

## Plotting the yield curve

We are going to create three plots here.

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960


```{r yield_curve_1: Yields on US rates by duration since 1960, out.width="100%",fig.width=15, fig.height=12}
# unique(yield_curve$duration)
yield_curve <- yield_curve %>%
  #factor the duration variable in the correct order
  mutate(duration=factor(duration,levels = c("3-Month Treasury Bill","6-Month Treasury Bill","1-Year Treasury Rate","2-Year Treasury Rate",
                                          "3-Year Treasury Rate","5-Year Treasury Rate","7-Year Treasury Rate","10-Year Treasury Rate",
                                          "20-Year Treasury Rate","30-Year Treasury Rate"))) 

ggplot(yield_curve,aes(x=date,y=value,color=duration))+
  geom_line()+
  #ncol sets the number of columns in the plot
  facet_wrap(~duration,ncol=2)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title =element_text(size=16, face='bold',hjust = 0,margin = margin(10,0,10,0)),
        plot.subtitle =element_text(size=16, hjust = 0), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=12),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_line(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size=16,face='bold'),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=16,face='bold'),
        ) +
  labs(title = "Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960", 
       caption= "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)",
       x="",y="%") 
```

### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r yield_curve_2: Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis,out.width="100%",fig.width=15, fig.height=12}
yield_curve <- yield_curve %>%
  mutate(year=year(date),
         month=month(date),
         # for maturity, we also factor this variable in the correct order
         maturity=factor(maturity,levels = c("3m","6m","1y","2y",
                                          "3y","5y","7y","10y",
                                          "20y","30y")))
  

yield_curve %>%
  filter(year>=1999) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_line(aes(x=maturity,y=value,group=month,color=factor(year)))+
  facet_wrap(~year,ncol=4)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title =element_text(size=16, face='bold',hjust = 0,margin = margin(10,0,10,0)),
        plot.subtitle =element_text(size=16, hjust = 0), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=12),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_line(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size=16,face='bold'),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=16,face='bold'),
        ) +
  labs(title = "US Yield Curve: monthly yields by duration on a year-by-year basis", 
       caption= "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)",
       x="Maturity",y="Yield(%)") 

```
