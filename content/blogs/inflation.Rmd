We load all the libraries:

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(vroom)
library(tidyquant)
library(rvest) # to scrape wikipedia page
library(kableExtra)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(ggrepel)
```

1. We scrape the FRED website and pull all of the CPI components into a vector


```{r, scape CPI data}
library(rvest)
url <- "https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843"

tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")

cpi <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names()) 

cpi_id = cpi[[2]]$series_id

```

2. Once we have a vector of components, you can then pass it to `tidyquant::tq_get(get = "economic.data", from =  "2000-01-01")` to get all data since January 1, 2000
```{r, get all data since January 1, 2000}
cpi_data <- tidyquant::tq_get(cpi_id, get = "economic.data", from =  "2000-01-01")
```


3. Since the data you download is an index with various starting dates, we need to calculate the yearly, or 12-month change. To do this we need to use the `lag` function, and specifically, `year_change = value/lag(value, 12) - 1`; this means that we are comparing the current month's value with that 12 months ago lag(value, 12).
```{r, calculate year change}
cpi_data_clean <- cpi_data %>% pivot_wider(id_cols=1:3, 
               names_from="symbol", 
               values_from = "price")

#Make date the index to make mutate_all work
cpi_data_clean1 <- cpi_data_clean %>% 
     remove_rownames() %>%
     column_to_rownames(var = 'date')

#Define Function
Funk <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE) (x/lag(x, 12) - 1)

#Apply functions to all columns into new dataset
cpi_changes <- cpi_data_clean1 %>%  mutate_all(
  Funk
)

```

Below we format the graph

4. We order components so the higher the yearly change, the earlier does that component appear.
5. We also make sure that the **All Items** CPI (CPIAUCSL) appears first.
6. We then add a `geom_smooth()` for each component to get a sense of the overall trend.
7  Finally, we colour the points according to whether yearly change was positive or negative. 

```{r, format the graph, fig.width=15, fig.height=12}
# Make date back as first column for pivot_longer
cpi_changes <- cbind("Date" = rownames(cpi_changes), cpi_changes)

cpi_changes_graph <- cpi_changes %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:50, 
               names_to="Component", 
               values_to = "YoY")

cpi_changes_graph <- cpi_changes_graph %>% mutate(
  Neg = (YoY<=0)
)

cpi_changes_graph$Date <- as.Date(cpi_changes_graph$Date, "%Y-%m-%d")

# Get our order of components by max descending (excl. All Items)
cpi_order <- cpi_changes_graph %>%
  filter(Date>="2016-01-01") %>%
  filter(Component != "CPIAUCSL") %>% 
  group_by(Component) %>% 
  summarise(max_YoY = max(YoY,na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(-max_YoY)

# Put the all items at the start (append)
order = c(cpi_order$Component)
order = append("CPIAUCSL", order)
order

cpi_changes_graph %>%
  filter(Date>="2016-01-01") %>% 
  group_by(Component) %>% 
  mutate(
    max_cpi = max(YoY)
  )
  
# Graph

  filter(Date>="2016-01-01") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Date, YoY)) + 
  geom_point(size=1, aes(colour = Neg)) +
  geom_smooth(se=F, colour="grey") +
  facet_wrap(~factor(Component, levels = order),scales="free")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  scale_x_date(breaks = as.Date(c("2016-01-01", "2018-01-01","2020-01-01")), labels=c("2016", "2018", "2020"),
               minor_breaks = as.Date(c("2016-01-01", "2018-01-01",
                                        "2020-01-01")))+

    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10, colour= "black"),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size=10, colour = "black"),    
    axis.title.y = element_text(size=10, colour = "black"))+
  
  labs(title="Yearly change of US CPI (All Items) and its components", 
       subtitle = "Year on year change being positive or negative

       x="Year", 
       y="YoY % Change")

                     
                     
```

<!-- As you can see, we get a similar graph to the target figure below, with identical layout of the facetted graphs. Note that the individual graph headings below were not available in the dataset scraped from FRED, so we used the component IDs instead.  -->
<!-- ```{r cpi_all_components_since_2016, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cpi_components_since_2016.png")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

We now graph the major categories (Housing, Transportation, Food and beverages, Medical care, Education and communication, Recreation, and Apparel), sorted according to their relative importance.
```{r, plot yearly change in CPI using major categories, fig.width=12, fig.height=12}
