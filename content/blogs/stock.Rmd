# Returns of financial stocks


We first load this code to get the data 

```{r, tickers_from_wikipedia}

djia_url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average"


#get tables that exist on URL
tables <- djia_url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called djia. 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
djia <- map(tables, . %>% 
               html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
               clean_names())


# constituents
table1 <- djia[[2]] %>% # the second table on the page contains the ticker symbols
  mutate(date_added = ymd(date_added),
         
         # if a stock is listed on NYSE, its symbol is, e.g., NYSE: MMM
         # We will get prices from yahoo finance which requires just the ticker
         
         # if symbol contains "NYSE*", the * being a wildcard
         # then we jsut drop the first 6 characters in that string
         ticker = ifelse(str_detect(symbol, "NYSE*"),
                          str_sub(symbol,7,11),
                          symbol)
         )

# we need a vector of strings with just the 30 tickers + SPY
tickers <- table1 %>% 
  select(ticker) %>% 
  pull() %>% # pull() gets them as a sting of characters
  c("SPY") # and lets us add SPY, the SP500 ETF
```

Now let us downlaod prices for all 30 DJIA consituents and the SPY ETF that tracks SP500 since January 1, 2020


```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument in the chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, # cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- tickers %>% 
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2000-01-01",
         to   = Sys.Date()) %>% # Sys.Date() returns today's price
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.



```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))

myStocks_returns_monthly
```

Create a table where you summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}

monthly_stock_performance <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>%
  select(symbol,monthly_returns) %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  summarise(mean_monthly_return=mean(monthly_returns),
            median_monthly_return=median(monthly_returns),
            sd_monthly_return=sd(monthly_returns),
            min_monthly_return=min(monthly_returns),
            max_monthly_return=max(monthly_returns)) %>%
  arrange(-mean_monthly_return)

monthly_stock_performance
```


Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks
```{r density_monthly_returns}
density_plot <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>%
  ggplot(aes(monthly_returns))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_wrap(vars(symbol))+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title = "Density plot for each stock from DJIA",
    subtitle = "Stock monthly returns seem to follow a normal distribution ",
    x = "Monthly returns",
    y = "Density "
  )+
  NULL

density_plot

```



The spread of the curves corresponds to the volatility of the monthly returns. The higher the spread, thee higher the volatility of the monthly returns implying a greater risk for an investment. For example, companies like JNJ or SPY seems to have a small spread relative to other stocks. These stocks can be described as the least risky. Stocks like AAPL and DOW have the largest spread and therefore are considered as the riskist.

The peak of the curve correspond to the potential return on investment , the higher the peak (which corresponds to the mean of the distribution, assuming that is normal), the higher the returns on these stocks. Companies like PG and SPY seems to have the highest potential.

Finally, make a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock

```{r risk_return_plot}
mean_vs_sd_plot <- monthly_stock_performance %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=sd_monthly_return,y=mean_monthly_return,label=symbol))+
  geom_point(colour="red")+
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel()+ #to label each stock
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title = "Expected monthly return against risk",
    subtitle = "We can see that this graph corresponds to an efficient frontier",
    x = "Standard deviation",
    y = "Expected monthly return"
  )+
  NULL

mean_vs_sd_plot

```


This plot allows us to understand better which stocks with a given level of risk, give a higher return. For example, IBM and V(VISA) have a similar risk level but V(VISA) offers a much higher return. CSCO for example has an approximate standard deviation of 0.097 and the same return of SPY which has a much lower risk. Therefore, this graph helps us making the best risk return combinations in terms of portfolio management.
