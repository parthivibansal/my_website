# Introduction: This exercise makes an interesting geographic map of the airbnb in Vienna so that we can click at the airbnb we want to check out!

We first load the data and parse the orice into an integer:
```{r load_data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# use cache=TRUE so you dont donwload the data everytime you knit
vienna_listings <- vroom("http://data.insideairbnb.com/austria/vienna/vienna/2021-09-12/data/listings.csv.gz") %>%
  clean_names()
```

```{r parse price}
# Price is a character, parse to integer
vienna_listings <- vienna_listings %>% 
  mutate(price = parse_number(price))
```

Following is an explanation of some of the variables in our data set:

- `price` = cost per night 
- `property_type`: type of accommodation (House, Apartment, etc.)
- `room_type`:

  - Entire home/apt (guests have entire place to themselves)
  - Private room (Guests have private room to sleep, all other rooms shared)
  - Shared room (Guests sleep in room shared with others)

- `number_of_reviews`: Total number of reviews for the listing
- `review_scores_rating`: Average review score (0 - 100)
- `longitude` , `latitude`: geographical coordinates to help us locate the listing
- `neighbourhood*`: three variables on a few major neighbourhoods in each city 


# Mapping 

Visualisations of feature distributions and their relations are key to understanding a data set, and they can open up new lines of exploration. For this visualisation we use the `leaflet` package, which includes a variety of tools for interactive maps.

The following code, having downloaded a dataframe `listings` with all AirbnB listings in Milan, will plot on the map all AirBnBs where `minimum_nights` is less than equal to four (4). 

```{r, creating a visuaisation, out.width = '80%'}

leaflet(data = filter(vienna_listings, minimum_nights <= 4)) %>% #filtering for minimum nights criteria 
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude,  
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   radius = 1, 
                   fillColor = "blue", 
                   fillOpacity = 0.4, 
                   popup = ~listing_url,
                   label = ~property_type)
```

#Using this map, we can be redirected to any airbnb we want to check out along with an overview of their location. We know move on to exploratory analysis.
